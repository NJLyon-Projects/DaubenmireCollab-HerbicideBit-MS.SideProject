# PURPOSE ####
  ## The revise & resubmit review we got at Rangeland Ecology and Management requires a âˆ† of stats
  ## So, rather that changing the *many* tests we ran prior to this
  ## I'm just going to write a totally new script for just the final version of this paper
  ## If you're a reader of the paper, this includes 100% of the results in the publication

# Set the working directory
setwd("~/Documents/School/_Publications/2020_Coon_Daubenmire SnS/Daubenmire.HerbicideComponent.WD")
  ## if you're not me you will need to re-set this to your own computer.

# Clear the environment
rm(list = ls())

# Load required libraries
library(lme4); library(lmerTest)
